# ControleFinanceiroGracipelliniFront

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.1.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Run with Docker Compose (Front + API)

This project now uses `/api` as API base URL.

- Local development (`ng serve`) uses [`proxy.conf.json`](./proxy.conf.json) and forwards `/api` to `http://localhost:3000`.
- Production container uses [`nginx.conf`](./nginx.conf) and forwards `/api` to the `api` service in Docker Compose.

### 1) Configure the API service

Edit [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) and set your API image:

```yaml
api:
  image: ghcr.io/seu-usuario/controle-financeiro-api:latest
```

If your API repository is in the same EC2 folder, you can use `build` instead of `image` (example already commented in the file).

### 2) Start on EC2

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Access:

- Frontend: `http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>/`
- API through frontend proxy: `http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>/api/...`

### 3) EC2 requirements

- Security Group inbound:
  - `80/tcp` from your allowed sources
  - `22/tcp` for SSH
- Docker and Docker Compose plugin installed on the instance.
